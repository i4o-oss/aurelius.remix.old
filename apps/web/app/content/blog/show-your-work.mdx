Show Your Work is the first book you should read if you want to do any creative endeavor. Austin's writing is down-to-earth, funny, and filled with practical advice for anyone who wants to be a creator.

Here are some of the top takeaways from the book:

Showing your work isn't just for professionals. Anyone can share what they're working on and what they're learning. Even if you're a beginner in your craft.

> _We're all terrified of being revealed as amateurs, but in fact, today it is the amateur — the enthusiast who pursues her work in the spirit of love, regardless of the potential for fame, money, or career — who often has the advantage over the professional. Because they have little to lose, amateurs are willing to try anything and share the results. They take chances, experiment, and follow their whims. Sometimes, in the process of doing things the unprofessional way, they make new discoveries._

When you're just starting out, sharing the stuff you work on can make a big difference in helping you figure out what your niche is and who you want to be.

> _We're always told find your voice. When I was younger, I never really knew what this meant. I used to worry a lot about voice, wondering if I had my own. But now I realise that the only way to find your voice is to use it. It's hardwired, built into you. Talk about the things you love. Your voice will follow._

> _It sounds a little extreme, but in this day and age, if your work isn't online, it doesn't exist. We all have the opportunity to use our voices, to have our say, but so many of us are wasting it. If you want people to know about what you do and the things you care about, you have to share._

But we all feel a little hesitant when we have to share our work in public. What do we share? How do I begin to show my work?

> _Become a documentarian of what you do. Start a work journal: Write your thoughts down in a notebook, or speak them into an audio recorder. Keep a scrapbook. Take a lot of photographs of your work at different stages in your process. Shoot video of you working._
>

> _Once a day, after you've done your day's work, go back to your documentation and find one little piece of your process you can share. Where you are in the process will determine what that piece is. If you're in the very early stages, share your influences and what's inspiring you. If you're in the middle of executing a project, write about your methods or share works in progress. If you've just completed a project, show the final product, share scraps from the cutting-room floor, or write about what you learned._

One of the common excuses people tell themselves is that there's no time. But we see others sharing their stuff on social media all the time.

> _Don't say you don't have enough time. We're all busy, but we all get 24 hours a day. Find time. Find time like you find spare change: in the nooks and crannies. Find the gaps between the important, big stuff — commute, lunch break, between meetings. Look for it and you will find it._

Sharing our work and calling it a day is not enough. To be more effective and reach more people, we have to become storytellers. People with big audiences got there by learning how to tell good stories.

> _Whether you realise it or not, you're already telling a story about your work. Every email you send, every text, every conversation, every blog comment, every tweet, every photo, every video — they're all bits and pieces of a multimedia narrative you're constantly constructing. If you want to be more effective when sharing yourself and your work, you need to become a better storyteller. You need to know what a good story is and how to tell one._

When you've been sharing your work for a while, but don't see any results, don't quit.

> _The people who get what they're after are very often the ones who just stick around long enough. It's very important not to quit prematurely._

Whether your current project is a success or a failure, it's important to keep going and not to lose momentum. This is the only way to make sure that our careers don't stall, that we don't rest on our successes or lose motivation because of our failures. Austin calls this way of working, chain-smoking.

> _Instead of taking a break in between projects, waiting for feedback, and worrying about what's next, use the end of one project to light up the next one. Just do the work that's in front of you, and when it's finished, ask yourself what you missed, what you could've done better, or what you couldn't get to, and jump right into the next project._

And he finally concludes with:

> _The thing is, you never start over. You don't lose all the work that's come before. Even if you try to toss it aside, the lessons that you've learned from it will seep into what you do next. So don't think of it as starting over. Think of it as beginning again. Go back to chapter one and become an amateur. Look for something new to learn, and when you find it, dedicate yourself to learning it out in the open. Document your progress and share as you go so that others can learn along with you. Show your work, and when the right people show up, pay close attention to them, because they'll have a lot to show you._

Show Your Work is a must read.
