Welcome to Aurelius' Blog.

This is Ilango, the creator of Aurelius. I want to tell you a little bit about Aurelius and why I'm building it.

Aurelius was born out of a need for a writing app that suited my needs. After trying many writing apps — code editors to note-taking apps — none of them felt quite right for me. Some of them have poor writing experience of doing too much stuff. That's usually the case for software that's withstood the test of time. Features accumulated over years.

But I wanted a simple writing app that has features for building a writing habit while having an enjoyable writing experience. I wanted to keep the base writing experience simple while having powerful features that would fit the kind of writing that I want to do in the future. And I hope that you will find Aurelius fits your needs as well.

One of the things I wanted in my ideal writing app is to help me build a writing habit. I've struggled in the past to keep writing consistently. I imagine there are plenty of people like me who have the same struggle. This struggle sometimes applies even to professional writers. So I'll be building features with that in mind, useful for both the beginner and the seasoned writer.

I also wanted something modern, with a clean, minimal interface, and built on a modern tech stack. Some parts of the tech stack were chosen because I wanted to learn them. There might be new things added to the stack based on the requirements of the product, but for the time being I'm happy with it.

## Why Aurelius?

I chose Aurelius as the name for this app for a specific reason. It's obviously named after Marcus Aurelius, the last of the great Roman emperors. Meditations, his journal, was not meant to be published but it surprisingly survived and has made an impact thousands of years later.

Aurelius wrote for himself, not meaning to publish his philosophical musings but as a tool for his own guidance and improvement. That's what I wish for me and you. Writing because we want to write, because we have something to say, is at the core of Aurelius.

I hope Aurelius inspires you to write, first and foremost for yourself, no matter what your end goal is.

My goals as a writer are to hone my writing skills for my career as a software engineer and also to explore topics that interest me and write essays and books about them.

This is probably the most important reason why I started working on Aurelius. I wanted a companion tool that grows with me, as I learn to become a better writer. I wish you would join me on this journey too.

## Join Me

I'm excited for where Aurelius will go, and where it will take me as its creator and a writer. I've some cool things planned and I'm excited to share it with you.
