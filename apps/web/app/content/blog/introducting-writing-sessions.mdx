In Atomic Habits, James Clear talks about a concept called [_implementation intention_](https://jamesclear.com/implementation-intentions). Essentially, if you decide ahead of time the action you're going to take and put a constraint on it (time and place), you're much more likely to perform that action.

Writing sessions helps you do that for your writing habit. Every day, when you're about to start writing, I recommend you start a new writing session in Aurelius. This sets your intentions for the session and helps you get into flow.

When you're starting a new writing session, Aurelius will present you with a few options.

## Word Count or Duration

Pick a goal for the session — duration or word count. You can then choose a target (number of words or minutes) for the selected goal. I recommend you start with 200 words or 20 minutes. You can increase the target once you build up a streak.

Once you start the session, Aurelius will keep track of your writing progress.

## Stop when the session ends

The biggest benefit of writing sessions is that it has an end.

Robert Boice, in his book How Writers Journey to Comfort and Fluency recommends that you stop writing once you met your target word count or duration, even if you're in the middle of a sentence.

> “The urge to continue, includes a big component of impatience about not being finished, about not being productive enough, about never again finding such an ideal time for writing.”

Aurelius will notify you once you're writing session has ended. You can choose to keep writing if you really want to. Aurelius will get out of your way and keep the session going till you manually stop it. You can also pause the session and take a break when you're doing longer writing sessions.

## Session Recap

Once you end the session, Aurelius will show you a recap of your session. The recap will have the target you chose (number of words or minutes), number of words written in that session, and the total time you've written (even if you picked word count as the goal).

## Focus Mode and Music

There are a couple more optional settings for your writing session:

*   Focus Mode
    
*   Music
    

Focus mode will fade everything on the screen except for the editor. For an extra bit of focus, you can press `F11` on your keyboard to make the browser full-screen.

You can also choose to play music automatically at the start of the session. Aurelius will play the video or playlist you've chosen in settings or play a lo-fi music playlist if you haven't.

Both focus mode and music are enabled by default.

Aurelius will save the details of the writing session once you're done. This works even if you don't have an account. I plan to use this data later to show you detailed history on your writing sessions and how you have improved.

## Write away!

Writing Sessions is available today. This is one of many great features that I've planned to help you build a writing habit.

Happy Writing!
