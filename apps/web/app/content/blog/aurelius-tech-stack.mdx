I like to keep my tech stack simple, but it tends to grow as an app takes shape and we need more functionality without building everything from scratch. So we tend to rely on tools and services operated by third parties to build and run a web application like Aurelius.

Here's a rundown of what tech makes up Aurelius:

## Remix: The Backbone

Remix is a meta web framework. That means that Remix takes care of many things that web developers would typically assemble themselves. This includes stuff like:

*   Having a good development experience in our local machines before it is pushed to servers.
    
*   Listening for code changes and automatically compiling them.
    
*   Handling navigation between different pages on the website
    
*   Fetching data from the database
    
*   and more.
    

Remix is undoubtedly not the only option. Other options are just as good or even better than Remix (for now). But I happen to like Remix a lot because of how simple the mental model is for thinking about building websites and web apps. I like almost everything about Remix. The ones I don't are actively being worked on.

## PlanetScale: The Database

All the data about users, posts, writing sessions, and the features that I build in the future have to be saved somewhere. PlanetScale is that place. PlanetScale is a hosted database service, which means I don't have to do the tedious job of running and maintaining a database.

PlanetScale also has a very generous free tier and scales well with increasing usage. Most importantly, it is a joy to work with. PlanetScale makes it incredibly simple to save and read data in our apps.

## Railway: The Host

Aurelius is hosted on and served over the internet by Railway. Railway is a cloud service provider. Like PlanetScale, Railway takes care of maintaining the networks, virtual machines, security, automation, and a lot more while I just focus on building Aurelius.

It hardly takes any effort to host web apps on Railway. All I need to do is run one command on my PC and Railway takes care of the rest.

## GitHub: The Source

All the source code of Aurelius lives on GitHub. And if you didn't already know, Aurelius is open-source software. That means the source code of Aurelius is 100% free and open for everyone to see. This includes all current free and premium features and will include everything that I build in the future. If you choose to (and have a little technical knowledge), you can run Aurelius on your servers for your personal use (only).

GitHub is also the place where I host the public roadmap. But I only do this for free features. For premium features, I use a project management software called Linear.

## Linear: The Planner

Linear is a project-management software made for software projects. It is built for use by developers and has a ton of useful features. The project management software niche is overflowing with tools and apps but Linear is the one that I like. I keep things relatively simple, as I'm a solo dev but Linear also works well for teams.

* * *

These are only the major tools and services that make up Aurelius. Behind the scenes there are lot more code libraries and tools that help I use to build and deploy Aurelius. Explaining them would mean I'd have to get a lot more technical in this post. I write those kind of in-depth technical articles on my personal blog.

But here are some honorable mentions:

*   Tiptap - This is the code library that I use to build the editor in Aurelius.
    
*   Prisma - Connects Remix and PlanetScale and makes it easy to read and write data.
    
*   Catalyst UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind CSS - Help me build the user interface quickly
    
*   Pnpm - Runs local scripts that I use to build Aurelius
    
*   Turborepo - Helps manage code dependencies and running tasks in my local machine.
    

If there's any more questions about the tech stack, feel free to reach out to me. I like talking about this topic and I'd be glad to answer any questions.
