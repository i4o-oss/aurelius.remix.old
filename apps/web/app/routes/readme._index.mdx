Aurelius was born out of a requirement for a writing app that suited my needs. After trying many writing apps — from code editors to note-taking apps — none help start and maintain a writing habit. Some of them have poor writing experience of doing too much stuff, have too much clutter, and feel archaic.

Since I'm a software engineer, I decided to build something that works for me. Here are some of the things that I felt were important when building a modern writing app.

### Clutter and Distractions

A good writing app doesn't need bells and whistles. It needs to do one thing well — allow you to write. Everything else is optional. I thought a lot about this one aspect while redesigning the interface.

The writing part is front and center. Everything else that enhances or supports the writing is moved well out of the way. Most of those options can be accessed from one button on the top left of the homepage.

Speaking of the homepage, the writing app is the homepage. It is common for websites to have a landing page that explains what the website does along with all its features and more. Aurelius doesn't have that. When you visit [aurelius.ink](https://aurelius.ink) you can start writing right away. But there still should be a landing page which is why the [home page](https://aurelius.ink/home) exists.

This might seem daunting for first-time visitors but with time I hope they'll get used to it. Still, I wanted to make it a bit easier so there's a welcome popup with a short list of common actions.

Aurelius also has a focus mode. When you want even the minimal UI out of the way when you're writing, you can make them almost invisible with the focus mode. When you want to focus on the writing, Aurelius will help you get there.

### Future Proof

It's all too common for apps to shutdown. When this happens the users of those apps are forced to migrate to a different one. Often the one that they switched to are not optimal.

While I'm confident that I will run Aurelius for a very long time, there could be unforeseen circumstances. To solve this problem, I'm making the source code for Aurelius open and publicly available for everyone.

I'm currently working on a guide on how anyone can run their own versions of Aurelius with little to no cost.

### Local-first

You don't need to sign up to Aurelius for writing with it. You can visit [aurelius.ink](https://aurelius.ink) and start writing. Everything you writing with Aurelius is stored on your browser. Since all your data is stored on your device, you get instant access to all of it. And you own everything.

But for now, this means that you are restricted to one device in which you can do all your writing. I'm trying to figure out ways that I can make your writing available across multiple devices even when the data is stored locally.

You can however, sign up to Aurelius and buy a lifetime license. This will enable cloud backups and you can access all your writing in any number of devices. It does mean that you give away a tiny bit of control over your data but I promise it's safe and secure. Not even I have access to your writings.
